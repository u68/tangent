# Tangent

This is an operating system / kernel for *nx u8-100* devices ||Casio cwii calcs ðŸ¤«||

Currently, it does not work or I have not been bothered to test it, BUT I am working on it little by little, I would say it will be done in about a week and a bit.

## Usage

Because it is not finished, you can't really use it, but I plan on making it so it can be budled with programs after building and then be ran on an emulator or real hardware, I see no real use case for this project, it is really just a fun little thing that I find pretty neat.

Have fun with it!
